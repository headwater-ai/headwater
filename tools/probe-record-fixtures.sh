# What holds `tools/probe-transform.sh` and `tools/probe-record.sh`.
#
# The pair exists to stop one thing: a model's account of its own process
# reaching `docs/probe-runs/` as if it were an observation. So the cases below
# are not "the thinking block is gone". They are written against the three ways
# a transform can drop a thinking block and still be wrong.
#
# 1. A transform that whitelists by **position** — the first block, the last
#    block — passes a sample where the prose happens to sit where it sat.
# 2. A transform that whitelists by **index** into `message.content` passes for
#    the same reason.
# 3. A transform that drops **the block tags it saw in a sample** passes until
#    a harness emits one it did not see.
#
# The decisive case defeats all three at once: a log whose `thinking` and
# `text` blocks carry content shaped like the fields of a transcript — a
# literal `calls:` YAML fragment, a `tool: Read` line, a plausible digest — and
# the assertion is that **no byte of any non-`tool_use`/`tool_result` block
# appears in the output**. A transform that keeps such a block by any of the
# three rules above writes a self-report that reads as a recording.
#
# The other half of the same property is the negative direction: the raw
# harness log fed to `headwater probe record` is refused on keys outside the
# closed sets. The filter exists to restore what that refusal protects.
#
#     sh tools/probe-record-fixtures.sh
#
# It needs `jq`, exits 3 without it so CI can skip with a warning, and writes
# only under a temporary directory.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The decisive log.
#
# Every non-call block carries content shaped like a transcript field. The
# `thinking` block writes a whole event; the first `text` block writes a
# `tool: Read` line and a digest; the second `text` block is the model's own
# summary of what it read. `redacted_thinking` is a tag this repository has
# never seen in a sample, and it carries the same bait: a transform that lists
# the tags it drops rather than the two it keeps lets it through.
#
# The tool calls are deliberately **not** first and **not** last, so a
# position rule or an index rule picks up prose either side of them.
