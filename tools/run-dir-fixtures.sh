# What holds `tools/run-dir.sh`, the run directory of a build-order run.
#
# The tool makes one directory and refuses three things: a second start under
# one id, a log line missing a key, and a log line that stores a total. Each
# refusal is provoked below, and so is each pass, because a ledger tool that
# refused nothing would be `cat >>` with a longer name. The derived total is
# held against the arithmetic of the lines that were written, which is the
# whole of what [HW-PD-0005] and [HW-DR-0049] ask of a ledger.
#
# Run it from anywhere:
#     sh tools/run-dir-fixtures.sh
#
# It needs `jq` and nothing else, it points the tool at a scratch root through
# `HEADWATER_RUN_ROOT`, and it writes nothing under the git common dir or the
# checkout.
